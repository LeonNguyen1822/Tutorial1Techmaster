     <h2> HOW TO MAKE THE PERFECT CAKES?</h2>
     <p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
     <p>&#9679;Always read the entire recipe before you begin.<b> Make sure you have all the ingredients and tools needed to bake the cake.</b>

<b>Make sure the ingredients are room temperature</b>. Ingredients that are room temperature are easier to combine. Butter must be softened in order to cream it with sugar. Cold milk will turn perfectly softened butter into a clumpy mess. And cold eggs are almost impossible to thoroughly mix into cake batter.</p>
  <p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
     <p>&#9679;<b>Mesure the ingredients properly</b>. If well measurements are included in the recipes, be sure to use the scale and weigh the ingredients correctly. If no weight measurements are given, always measure the dry ingredients by spooning them into a dry measuring cup and level it off with the back of a knife. </p>
     <p><b>Step 3:</b></p>
     <p>&#9679;Take care not to overbake the cake. The cake is ready once a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few dry crumbs on it. If the toothpick comes out completely clean, the cake is overbaked.

Cool the cakes in the pan on wire rack for 10 minutes before inverting them out onto a wire rack to cool completely.<b> Make sure the cake is completely cool before frosting.</b></p>
